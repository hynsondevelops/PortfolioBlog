Itemized lists\r\nlook like:\r\n\r\n  * this one\r\n  * that one\r\n  * the other one\r\n\r\nNote that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text\r\ncontent starts at 4-columns in.\r\n\r\n> Block quotes are\r\n> written like so.\r\n>\r\n> They can span multiple paragraphs,\r\n> if you like.\r\n\r\nUse 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., \"it's all\r\nin chapters 12--14\"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.\r\nUnicode is supported. ☺\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn h2 header\r\n------------\r\n\r\nHere's a numbered list:\r\n\r\n 1. first item\r\n 2. second item\r\n 3. third item\r\n\r\nNote again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters\r\nfrom the left side). Here's a code sample:\r\n\r\n    # Let me re-iterate ...\r\n    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }\r\n\r\nAs you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of\r\nindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\ndefine foobar() {\r\n    print \"Welcome to flavor country!\";\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the\r\ndelimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:\r\n\r\n~~~python\r\nimport time\r\n# Quick, count to ten!\r\nfor i in range(10):\r\n    # (but not *too* quick)\r\n    time.sleep(0.5)\r\n    print i\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### An h3 header ###\r\n\r\nNow a nested list:\r\n\r\n 1. First, get these ingredients:\r\n\r\n      * carrots\r\n      * celery\r\n      * lentils\r\n\r\n 2. Boil some water.\r\n\r\n 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow\r\n    this algorithm:\r\n\r\n        find wooden spoon\r\n        uncover pot\r\n        stir\r\n        cover pot\r\n        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle\r\n        wait 10 minutes\r\n        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)\r\n\r\n    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.\r\n\r\nNotice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including\r\nthat last line which continues item 3 above).\r\n\r\nHere's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local\r\ndoc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current\r\ndoc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Footnote text goes here.\r\n\r\nTables can look like this:\r\n\r\nsize  material      color\r\n----  ------------  ------------\r\n9     leather       brown\r\n10    hemp canvas   natural\r\n11    glass         transparent\r\n\r\nTable: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of\r\n\r\n(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports\r\nmulti-line tables:\r\n\r\n--------  -----------------------\r\nkeyword   text\r\n--------  -----------------------\r\nred       Sunsets, apples, and\r\n          other red or reddish\r\n          things.\r\n\r\ngreen     Leaves, grass, frogs\r\n          and other things it's\r\n          not easy being.\r\n--------  -----------------------\r\n\r\nA horizontal rule follows.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHere's a definition list:\r\n\r\napples\r\n  : Good for making applesauce.\r\noranges\r\n  : Citrus!\r\ntomatoes\r\n  : There's no \"e\" in tomatoe.\r\n\r\nAgain, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each\r\nterm/definition pair to spread things out more.)\r\n\r\nHere's a \"line block\":\r\n\r\n| Line one\r\n|   Line too\r\n| Line tree\r\n\r\nand images can be specified like so:\r\n\r\n![example image](example-image.jpg \"An exemplary image\")\r\n\r\nInline math equations go in like so: $\\omega = d\\phi / dt$. Display\r\nmath should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:\r\n\r\n$$I = \\int \\rho R^{2} dV$$\r\n\r\nAnd note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters\r\nwhich you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \\`foo\\`, \\*bar\\*, etc.", "commit"=>"Save changes"}

Itemized lists\r\nlook like:\r\n\r\n  * this one\r\n  * that one\r\n  * the other one\r\n\r\nNote that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text\r\ncontent starts at 4-columns in.\r\n\r\n> Block quotes are\r\n> written like so.\r\n>\r\n> They can span multiple paragraphs,\r\n> if you like.\r\n\r\nUse 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., \"it's all\r\nin chapters 12--14\"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.\r\nUnicode is supported. ☺\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn h2 header\r\n------------\r\n\r\nHere's a numbered list:\r\n\r\n 1. first item\r\n 2. second item\r\n 3. third item\r\n\r\nNote again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters\r\nfrom the left side). Here's a code sample:\r\n\r\n    # Let me re-iterate ...\r\n    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }\r\n\r\nAs you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of\r\nindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\ndefine foobar() {\r\n    print \"Welcome to flavor country!\";\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the\r\ndelimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:\r\n\r\n~~~python\r\nimport time\r\n# Quick, count to ten!\r\nfor i in range(10):\r\n    # (but not *too* quick)\r\n    time.sleep(0.5)\r\n    print i\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### An h3 header ###\r\n\r\nNow a nested list:\r\n\r\n 1. First, get these ingredients:\r\n\r\n      * carrots\r\n      * celery\r\n      * lentils\r\n\r\n 2. Boil some water.\r\n\r\n 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow\r\n    this algorithm:\r\n\r\n        find wooden spoon\r\n        uncover pot\r\n        stir\r\n        cover pot\r\n        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle\r\n        wait 10 minutes\r\n        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)\r\n\r\n    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.\r\n\r\nNotice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including\r\nthat last line which continues item 3 above).\r\n\r\nHere's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local\r\ndoc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current\r\ndoc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].\r\n\r\n[^1]: Footnote text goes here.\r\n\r\nTables can look like this:\r\n\r\nsize  material      color\r\n----  ------------  ------------\r\n9     leather       brown\r\n10    hemp canvas   natural\r\n11    glass         transparent\r\n\r\nTable: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of\r\n\r\n(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports\r\nmulti-line tables:\r\n\r\n--------  -----------------------\r\nkeyword   text\r\n--------  -----------------------\r\nred       Sunsets, apples, and\r\n          other red or reddish\r\n          things.\r\n\r\ngreen     Leaves, grass, frogs\r\n          and other things it's\r\n          not easy being.\r\n--------  -----------------------\r\n\r\nA horizontal rule follows.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHere's a definition list:\r\n\r\napples\r\n  : Good for making applesauce.\r\noranges\r\n  : Citrus!\r\ntomatoes\r\n  : There's no \"e\" in tomatoe.\r\n\r\nAgain, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each\r\nterm/definition pair to spread things out more.)\r\n\r\nHere's a \"line block\":\r\n\r\n| Line one\r\n|   Line too\r\n| Line tree\r\n\r\nand images can be specified like so:\r\n\r\n![example image](example-image.jpg \"An exemplary image\")\r\n\r\nInline math equations go in like so: $\\omega = d\\phi / dt$. Display\r\nmath should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:\r\n\r\n$$I = \\int \\rho R^{2} dV$$\r\n\r\nAnd note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters\r\nwhich you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \\`foo\\`, \\*bar\\*, etc.", "commit"=>"Save changes"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information.

I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images.

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\r\n\r\n## Basic formatting\r\n\r\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\r\n\r\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\r\n\r\n## Lists\r\n\r\n### Ordered list\r\n\r\n1. Item 1\r\n2. A second item\r\n3. Number 3\r\n4. Ⅳ\r\n\r\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\r\n\r\n### Unordered list\r\n\r\n* An item\r\n* Another item\r\n* Yet another item\r\n* And there's more...\r\n\r\n## Paragraph modifiers\r\n\r\n### Code block\r\n\r\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\r\n\r\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\r\n\r\n### Quote\r\n\r\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\r\n\r\n## Headings\r\n\r\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\r\n\r\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\r\n\r\n### They can even contain `inline code`\r\n\r\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\r\n\r\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\r\n\r\n## URLs\r\n\r\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\r\n\r\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\r\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\r\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\r\n\r\n## Horizontal rule\r\n\r\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\r\n\r\n## Finally\r\n\r\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information.

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information.

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}

  Parameters: {"content"=>"# An exhibit of Markdown\n\nThis note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.\n\n*Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4. Ⅳ\n\n*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n## Paragraph modifiers\n\n### Code block\n\n    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.\n\nYou can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.\n\n### Quote\n\n> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>.\n\n## Horizontal rule\n\nA horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.\n\n---\n\nIt's sometimes handy for breaking things up.\n\n## Images\n\nMarkdown can also contain images. I'll need to add something here sometime.\n\n## Finally\n\nThere's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.\n\n\n  [1]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\n  [2]: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm\n  [3]: http://www.markitdown.net/\n  [4]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics\n  [5]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n"}
